                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>This project was for an interactive design and prototyping course. The focal point of the class was built upon a design of our choosing,
a design that would be built to benefit users in the school. Instead of making something
that only I wanted, I was challenged to make something that would benefit the majority
of the DePaul CDM body. Our project responded to the students who were struggling
with choosing a major, class, or even students who needed inspiration on their creative
endeavors by showcasing the works of other CDM (College of Digital Media) students.</p>
                <p>My contributions to the project were initially paper sketches, and I worked with my group to develop them into fully functional prototype pages. The first page I helped make was this browse page that categorized each CDM major into colors, and previewed student projects using a carousel. The next page I worked on was the major hub, which drew inspiration from YouTube's design in that it acted as a "major channel" of sorts. It essentially showcased popular and recent student work across different majors.</p>
                <p>My next contribution was the search page. It is a simple text box on a screen that prompts users to search for what
they are looking for. For this page, I
wanted to give users two things:
freedom to type what they want,
and a responsive system to show
what they want. The page would
respond as the user is typing in
criteria in order to assure them that
their search query is being
recognized (or not recognized) by
the database. I wanted to design
this system with good feedback and
easily locatable affordances.</p>
